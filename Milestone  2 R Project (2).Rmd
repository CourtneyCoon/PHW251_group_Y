#data is clean and ready to use
```

# The question I have(Moyra  : are we supposed to drop the rest of the columns that are not required? or do we keep all of them ? 
#The ones that we need" low population per square mile "pop12-sqm1'
#Med-age
#renters and homeowners (A high proportion of renters versus homeowners - we need to make a third variable )

# Description of dataset
All 3 data sets are CSV files. 


## What is the data source? How does the dataset relate to the group problem 
## statement and question?
### 1. Demographic: Census Data
Includes 58 observations with 22 variables. All are numeric or integers except
for the first column which is a character with county names.

### 2. Mortality: CA open data portal, California Department of Public Health 
Includes 147,784 observations with 10 variables. most are characters except for 
year and count of mortality.

### 3. Healthcare: CA open data portal, Department of Healthcare Access and Information
Includes 53,592 observations with 5 variables. 

#### How does the dataset relate to the group problem statement and question?
Allocated funding for healthcare  for vulnerable populations in California . 
Certain regions in California are considered to be vulnerable populations. Given that they need access to better funding, thereby providing access to better healthcare , we are able to allocate funds to certain regions . By utilizing all 3 data sets , we can focus on rural populations , seniors and renters , higher mortality rate and the counties that have average or below average funding available in the last 5 years.  

# Identify data types for 5+ data elements/columns/variables
#Identify 5+ data elements required for your specified scenario. If <5 elements are required to complete the analysis, please choose additional variables of interest in the data set to explore in this milestone.
### 1. Demographic Data : Population /:Type-Chr 
### 2. Demographic Data :name: /Type: Chr
### 3:Demographic: median_age/Type: Num
### 4.Demographics: Renter/Type: Num
### 5.Dermographics: Homeowner/Type:Num
### 6. Mortality: county: chr
### 7. Mortality: year: Type: chr
### 8. Mortality: Cause Mortality :Type:  chr
### 9. Mortality: Count: Type: chr
### 10.HCAI healthcare: oshph_project_status: Type: chr
### 11.HCAI healthcare: Date:Type: chr
### 12.HCAI healthcare: Total Costs:Type:Num
### 13.HCAI healthcare:County:Type:chr
###14.HCAI healthcare:: No of Oshpd projects:Type: Num

## Identify the desired type/format for each variableâ€”will you need to convert 
## any columns to numeric or another type? 
### 1. Mortality Data set: dropped last 2 columns that comprised of mainly "NA's) 
### 2. HCAI: changed "total_cost_projects" from chr to numeric 
### 3. 
### 4. 
### 5.   
### 6.   
### 7.
